# Welcome

## OpenShift CI Onboarding
This documentation is the result of the CSPI-QE teams efforts to test many (30+) OpenShift layered products. The results of these efforts will be that the [openshift/release](https://github.com/openshift/release) repository, which powers OpenShift CI, will be full of re-usable steps to install and test layered products on top of OpenShift. We aim to use this documentation to avoid the risk of bringing this functionality to OpenShift CI in a way that cannot be re-used or understood.

## Who Is Cloud Services and Platform Integration QE (CSPI-QE)?

> Cloud Services and Platform Integration QE (CSPI-QE) drives full coverage, and centralized execution of interoperability and integration testing across the Red Hat portfolio to validate operability, and prevent regressions from entering into production and GA releases.
  

The documentation in this repository is aimed at members and customers of the CSPI-QE team. 

Please see the [CSPI-QE team page on The Source](https://source.redhat.com/groups/public/cspi_qe) for additional information.
